# Scheduler

## Description
I was running in to a problem of having enough time in the day for class and anything else, so I set out to create a working work day scheduler! With this scheduler I have managed for users to add text to text areas within hour blocks and for that text to persist on the webpage load via local storage. Thanks to the help of my instructor and many of my classmates, during this process I have learned how to effeciently use Jqueries along with JavaScript to access and change CSS styles and my HTML to boot!
